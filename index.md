Well, hundreds of blogs and tutorials out there, why this?

Being a student, I have extensively searched for various good articles to understand the concepts and tried connecting them to their application. For example, many of us know what amplifier circuits are, but not how to design one for practical use and also which configuration to use for a particular application. This blog tries to narrow this gap.

Analog circuit design is an art and a puzzle to solve. I can totally relate it to lego blocks. Basic circuits are analogous to individual lego blocks and the building you build is analogous to the overall circuit you want to design. More the lego blocks we have, the better buildings we can build, but we lack the art to build a building of required shape using these blocks. All we need to understand is, what are the features of these individual blocks and when to use which block to get the required shape of the building.

The page targets electronic students helping them to understand the concepts in much better way and from different point of view. More emphasis is given to application of electronic circuits, rather than monotonous theory.
